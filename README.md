- 👋 Hi, I’m @HarriTheEditor
- 👀 I’m interested in javascript, html, lua and c++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning xmlhttprequest on javascript and the basics of c++.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate as I prefer to do my own projects and ideas.
- 📫 You can reach me at @harru_p on twitter.
- 😎 Oh yea, I made some cool projects like routetour and my currently work in progress, Harruchat.
